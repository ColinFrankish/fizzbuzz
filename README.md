An introduction to RSpec testing, using the popular 'Fizzbuzz' kata for 
beginners in Ruby/TDD testing. 

The idea is to pass the class numbers 1 through 100, returning 'fizz'
if the number is divisible by 3, 'buzz' if divisible by 5, and 'fizzbuzz' if 
divisible by both.

To run in the console use 'ruby fizzbuzz.rb'
